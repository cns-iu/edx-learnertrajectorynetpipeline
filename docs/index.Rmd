This is an R Markdown documentation for the visualizations produced using data processing and analysis results of the *edX Learner and Course Analytics* portion of the pipeling. Each figure is a statistical graph that created using [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/); numerous packages from [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), including  [plyr](https://github.com/hadley/plyr), [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/), [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/); the [colorspace](colorspace.r-forge.r-project.org) package was used to generate color palettes for the visualizations; RCurl for importing data from github.

The scripts use sample data generated by the scripts found at the [edX Learner and Course Analytics and Visualization Pipeline](https://github.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline) GitHub repository. These data sets are provided in the respository's [Data](https://github.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/tree/master/data) directory. The sample data sets are briefly described below. A full description of each data set and field list are available for download at [LINK]().

####Data A
Data A was created by the script  [edX-1-courseStructureMeta.R](https://github.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-1-courseStructureMeta.R). The data is a CSV of the the course structure used to represent the content of the MITxPro course, Architecture of Complex Systems, Fall 2016.

```{r dataA, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv(text=getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/master/data/dataA.csv", ssl.verifypeer = FALSE), header=T)
str(data)
```

####Data C
Data C was generated by the script [edX-6-moduleUseAnalysis.R](https://github.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-6-moduleUseAnalysis.R). The data represents an analysis of overall module engagement statistics for an identified all active student  in MITxPro course, Architecture of Complex Systems, Fall 2016, based on a list of all active students in the course that was created by *[edX-4-eventLogFormatter.R](https://github.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-4-eventLogFormatter.R)*

```{r dataC, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv(text=getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/master/data/dataC.csv",ssl.verifypeer = FALSE), header=T)
str(data)
```

####Data D
Data D was generated by the script [edX-7-moduleUseAnalysis.R](https://github.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-7-studentFeatureExtraction.R). The data represents an descriptive statistics for an active students enrolled in the in MITxPro course, Architecture of Complex Systems, Fall 2016. Information about students that could be used for re-identification of participants has been excluded from the data set, specifically, gender, year of birth (yob), and level of education (loe).

```{r dataD, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv(text=getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/master/data/dataD.csv",ssl.verifypeer = FALSE), header=T)
str(data)
```

####Data E
**Data E** was generated by combining three outputs of script [edX-6-moduleUseAnalysis.R](https://github.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-6-moduleUseAnalysis.R). Script *edX-6-moduleUseAnalysis.R* calculates statistics for modules use of certified and non-certified studnets in MITxPro course, Architecture of Complex Systems, Fall 2016.

Data E combines the *unq_stu*, *events*, and *totalTime* data from module use analysis applied to three different list of students: 
1. all students (data was taken from *Data C*), 
2. students who are certificate, 
3. students who were not certified.
The first set of data was taken from *Data C*. The remaining two sets of data in Data E were generated from lists of student identifiers based on from an analysis of the *cert_status* field in *Data D*.

```{r dataE, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv(text=getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/master/data/dataE.csv",ssl.verifypeer = FALSE), header=T)
str(data)
```
