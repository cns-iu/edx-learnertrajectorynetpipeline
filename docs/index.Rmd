##Note on the Sample Data and Visualizations

This is an R Markdown documentation for the visualizations produced using data processing and analysis results of the *edX Learner and Course Analytics* portion of the pipeline presented in the paper, Ginda, M., Richey, M. C., Cousino, M., & BÃ¶rner, K. (2019). [Visualizing learner engagement, performance, and trajectories to evaluate and optimize online course design](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0215964). *PloS one*, *14(5)*, e0215964.

The sample data and visualizations documented on this site use data processing and analytic results generated by the *[edX Learner and Course Analytics and Visualization Pipeline](https://github.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline)* for the MITxPro Fall 2016 course, **Architecture of Complex Systems (MITProfessionalX+SysEngxB1+3T2016)**.

The sample data sets are provided in the project GitHub repository's [Data](https://github.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/tree/master/data) directory. The sample data sets are briefly described below. A full description of each data set and field list described in the supplemental materials, *[S1 Appendix](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215964.s002)* of the *PloS one* paper.

Each figure is a statistical graph was created using [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/); numerous packages from [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), including  [plyr](https://github.com/hadley/plyr), [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/), [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/); the [colorspace](colorspace.r-forge.r-project.org) package was used to generate color palettes for the visualizations; RCurl for importing data from GitHub.

##Sample Data Index

####Data A
*Data A* was created by the script  [edX-1-courseStructureMeta.R](https://github.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-1-courseStructureMeta.R). The data is a CSV of the the course structure used to represent the content of the MITxPro course, Architecture of Complex Systems, Fall 2016.

```{r dataA, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv(text=getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/master/data/dataA.csv", ssl.verifypeer = FALSE), header=T)
str(data)
```

####Data B
*Data B* was created by the script  [edX-5-learnerTrajectoryNet.R](https://github.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-5-learnerTrajectoryNet.R). The data represents the learner trajectory network of a student that completed the MITxPro course, Architecture of Complex Systems, Fall 2016. 

The network uses JSON format that includes a list of node and list of edges. The nodes represent course structure, specially all content and activity modules, and description of the student's interaction with the content over the entire course. The edge list represents the student's transitions between course content nodes.

```{r dataB, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# data <- read.csv(text=getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/master/data/dataB.json", ssl.verifypeer = FALSE), header=T)
# str(data)
```

####Data C
*Data C* was generated by the script [edX-6-moduleUseAnalysis.R](https://github.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-6-moduleUseAnalysis.R). The data represents an analysis of overall module engagement statistics for an identified all active student  in MITxPro course, Architecture of Complex Systems, Fall 2016, based on a list of all active students in the course that was created by *[edX-4-eventLogFormatter.R](https://github.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-4-eventLogFormatter.R)*

```{r dataC, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv(text=getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/master/data/dataC.csv",ssl.verifypeer = FALSE), header=T)
str(data)
```

####Data D
*Data D* was generated by the script [edX-7-moduleUseAnalysis.R](https://github.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-7-studentFeatureExtraction.R). The data represents an descriptive statistics for an active students enrolled in the in MITxPro course, Architecture of Complex Systems, Fall 2016, based on a list of all active students in the course that was created by *[edX-4-eventLogFormatter.R](https://github.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-4-eventLogFormatter.R)*. 

Information about students that could be used for re-identification of participants has been excluded from the data set, specifically, gender, year of birth (yob), and level of education (loe).

```{r dataD, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv(text=getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/master/data/dataD.csv",ssl.verifypeer = FALSE), header=T)
str(data)
```

####Data E
*Data E* was generated by combining three outputs of script [edX-6-moduleUseAnalysis.R](https://github.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-6-moduleUseAnalysis.R) for active, certified and non-certified students. Script *edX-6-moduleUseAnalysis.R* calculates statistics for modules use of subsets list of students: 

1. all students (data was taken from *Data C*), 
2. students who are certificate, 
3. students who were not certified.certified and non-certified students in MITxPro course, Architecture of Complex Systems, Fall 2016.

Data E combines the `unq_stu`, `events`, `totalTime`, and `avgavgTimeStu` variables from module use analysis applied to three different The data set of active students is provided in from *Data C*. The remaining two sets of data in Data E were generated from lists of student identifiers based on from an analysis of the `cert_status` field in *Data D*.

```{r dataE, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv(text=getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/master/data/dataE.csv",ssl.verifypeer = FALSE), header=T)
str(data)
```
