# edX Learner and Course Analytics and Visualization Pipeline
The edX Learner and Course Analytics and Visualization Pipeline is analytics and visualization pipeline using edX course database and user logs, written in R:

* to extract and process learner users and performance data, course structures and event logs;
* create learner trajectory networks (see [Visualizations of learning trajectories in online courses (cns-iu/learning-trajectories)](https://github.com/cns-iu/learning-trajectories) for example visualization implementation);
* analyze the learener use of course content modules; and 
* aggregate student performance and interaction measurements for a given course.

Each script in the data processing pipeline is briefly described below:
1.	[edX-1-courseStructureMeta.R](https://github.com/mginda/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-1-courseStructureMeta.R) script extracts a the course structure from the edX Data Package files, . The course structure is used in processing log files and creating the node lists in learner trajectory networks. 
2.	[edX-2-studentUserList.R](https://github.com/mginda/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-2-studentUserList.R) 	script processes user profile data sets from the edX Data Package to identify active students in the course, and exclude instructors, teaching assistants and beta testers from the user log data sets.
3.	[edX-3-eventLogExtractor.R](https://github.com/mginda/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-3-eventLogExtractor.R) script processes the daily edX course’s event tracking logs (streaming JSON format) and the list of active students generated by the *edX-2-studentUserList* to extract a raw event log for each student in the course. The logs are saved as individual CSV files.
4.	[edX-4-eventLogFormatter.R](https://github.com/mginda/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-4-eventLogFormatter.R) script processes the individual active students event logs, extracted by the edX-3-eventLogExtractor.R script. The script uses the course structure data set generated by *edX-1-courseStructureMeta.R* script as part of the log processing. 
The script allows a researcher to identify the types of events that are maintained in the final event logs for a student for analysis. All events to the are aligned to the lowest level of the course structural hierarchy; provides temporal ordering and event period calculations and outlier estimates. The script loops through the identified list of active students, and sorts students into further groups based on the size of their processed log files (for example, the script separates students with fewer than 10 events to remove them from the analysis). The script creates of list of identified users based active and inactive students, not identified by edX-2-studentUserList.R. The preset parameters in the script were used with the goal of identifing meaningful user initiated interactions, while preserving the maximal amount of log responses. The script provides detailed comments explaining processing choices.
5.	[edX-5-learnerTrajectoryNet.R](https://github.com/mginda/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-5-learnerTrajectoryNet.R) script creates a learner trajectory network for each student in the course based on the individual’s processed event logs and user list generated by *edX-4-eventLogFormatter.R*. The script first creates an edge list to document transitions between modules in a course, and then creating a node list, which calculates the student's interaction statistics for each low level module in the course. 
The script exports a node and an edge lists for each student as CSV files, as well as a JSON formatted learner trajectory network that combines the nodes and edge lists data sets are combined into 
6.	[edX-6-moduleUseAnalysis.R](https://github.com/mginda/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-6-moduleUseAnalysis.R) script uses the node lists generated by *edX-5-learnerTrajectoryNet.R*. The script aggregates the node lists from individual students’ learner trajectory networks to provide an analysis centering the course structure overall student interactions and activity. Analysis is completed for the lowest modules in the course hierarchy. The results are saved as a CSV data that can be joined to the course structure data set produced by *edX-1-courseStructureMeta.R* script
7.	[edX-7-studentFeatureExtraction.R](https://github.com/mginda/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-7-studentFeatureExtraction.R) script uses the course metadata generated by the *edX-1-learnerTrajectoryNet.R* script, and output user list and processed student logs generated by the *edx-4-eventLogFormatter.R* script. The script loops through the list of student processed event logs to create a set of frequency statistics of student activity in an EdX course (e.g. number of sessions, events, unique modules, event_types), calculations of temporal use of content (overall, and relevant module and event types).

## A Note on Using the Learner Trajectory Network Pipeline
The processing scripts are provided under Apache License 2.0. Contributors provide permission for commercial use, modification, distribution, patent use, and private use.  Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code. The script is provided with a limited liability and warranty, use these data processing scripts with your own discretion, and make preservation copies of any source data prior to use.

Additional modifications are likely needed to make use of this pipeline when processing other course data sets that using the edX Data Package format specification. Organizational implementation of the edX learning management systems may use customized event log tracking systems, and courses may use different types of edX block modules, and logs may include types of events that were not encountered for this project (e.g. error events, or edX discussion forums). An exploratory analysis of the course structure and event logs is advisable at the outset of a project.
