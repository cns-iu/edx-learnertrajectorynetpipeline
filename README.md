# edX Student and Course Analytics and Visualization Pipeline
An data analytics and visualization pipeline using edX course database and user logs, written in R:

* to extract and process student users and performance data, course structures and event logs;
* create learner trajectory networks (see LTN networks visualization implementations at [Visualizations of student learning trajectories in online courses (cns-iu/learning-trajectories)](https://github.com/cns-iu/learning-trajectories));
* analyze the students use of course content modules; and 
* a data set of aggregate student performance and interaction measurements for a given course.

Each script in the data processing pipeline is briefly described below:
1.	[edX-1-courseStructureMeta.R](https://github.com/mginda/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-1-courseStructureMeta.R) script extracts a the course structure from the edX Data Package files, . The course structure is used in processing log files and creating the node lists in learner trajectory networks. 
2.	[edX-2-studentUserList.R](https://github.com/mginda/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-2-studentUserList.R) 	script processes user profile data sets from the edX Data Package to identify active students in the course, and exclude instructors, teaching assistants and beta testers from the user log data sets.
3.	[edX-3-eventLogExtractor.R](https://github.com/mginda/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-3-eventLogExtractor.R) script processes the daily edX course’s event tracking logs (streaming JSON format) and the list of active students generated by the edX-2-studentUserList to extract a raw event log for each student in the course. The logs are saved as individual CSV files.
4.	[edX-4-eventLogFormatter.R](https://github.com/mginda/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-4-eventLogFormatter.R) script processes logs extracted by the edX-3-eventLogExtractor.R script, and the course structure data set generated by edX-1-courseStructureMeta.R script. The script allows a researcher to identify the types of events that are maintained for a student analysis and aligns all events to the lowest level of the course structural hierarchy; provides temporal ordering and event period calculations and outlier estimates. The preset parameters set in the script were used in the data processing of learner interaction event logs for this paper, with the goal of limiting redundancy of server interactions to identify user initiated interactions while preserving the maximal amount of log responses. The script provides detailed comments explaining processing choices.
5.	[edX-5-learnerTrajectoryNet.R](https://github.com/mginda/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-5-learnerTrajectoryNet.R) script uses the logs processed edx-4-eventLogFormatter.R, and the course structure data set generated by edX-1-courseStructureMeta.R script. The script creates a learner trajectory network for each student in the course based on the individual’s processed event logs, by first creating an edge list to document transitions between modules in a course, and then creating a node list, which calculates interaction statistics for each low level module in the course. The nodes and edge lists data sets are combined into a JSON formatted learner trajectory network.
6.	[edX-6-moduleUseAnalysis.R](https://github.com/mginda/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-6-moduleUseAnalysis.R) script uses the node lists generated by edX-5-learnerTrajectoryNet.R. The script aggregates the node lists from individual students learner trajectory networks to provide a module-centered analysis student interactions and activity. Analysis is completed for the lowest modules in the course hierarchy. The results are saved as a CSV data that can be joined to the course structure data set produced by edX-1-courseStructureMeta.R script.

## A Note on Using the Learner Trajectory Network Pipeline
The processing scripts are provided under Apache License 2.0. Contributors provide permission for commercial use, modification, distribution, patent use, and private use.  Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code. The script is provided with a limited liability and warranty, use these data processing scripts with your own discretion, and make preservation copies of any source data prior to use.

Additional modifications are likely needed to make use of this pipeline when processing other course data sets that using the edX Data Package format specification. Organizational implementation of the edX learning management systems may use customized event log tracking systems, and courses may use different types of edX block modules, and logs may include types of events that were not encountered for this project (e.g. error events, or edX discussion forums). An exploratory analysis of the course structure and event logs is advisable at the outset of a project.
