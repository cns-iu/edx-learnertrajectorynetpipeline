# edX Student and Course Analytics and Visualization Pipeline
An data analytics and visualization pipeline using edX course database and user logs, written in R.
Learner Trajectory Network Pipeline

Analysis and visualization of learner performance and interactions used data compiled in the edX Data Package format, and which was processed with R scripts, which are provided via GitHub, at https://github.com/mginda/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline.

Each script in the data processing pipeline is briefly described below:
1.	[edX-1-courseStructureMeta.R](https://github.com/mginda/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-1-courseStructureMeta.R) script extracts a the course structure from the edX Data Package files, . The course structure is used in processing log files and creating the node lists in learner trajectory networks. 
2.	[edX-2-studentUserList.R](https://github.com/mginda/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-2-studentUserList.R) 	script processes user profile data sets from the edX Data Package to identify active students in the course, and exclude instructors, teaching assistants and beta testers from the user log data sets.
3.	[edX-3-eventLogExtractor.R](https://github.com/mginda/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-3-eventLogExtractor.R) script processes the daily edX course’s event tracking logs (streaming JSON format) and the list of active students generated by the edX-2-studentUserList to extract a raw event log for each student in the course. The logs are saved as individual CSV files.
4.	[edX-4-eventLogFormatter.R](https://github.com/mginda/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-4-eventLogFormatter.R) script processes logs extracted by the edX-3-eventLogExtractor.R script, and the course structure data set generated by edX-1-courseStructureMeta.R script. The script allows a researcher to identify the types of events that are maintained for a student analysis and aligns all events to the lowest level of the course structural hierarchy; provides temporal ordering and event period calculations and outlier estimates. The preset parameters set in the script were used in the data processing of learner interaction event logs for this paper, with the goal of limiting redundancy of server interactions to identify user initiated interactions while preserving the maximal amount of log responses. The script provides detailed comments explaining processing choices.
5.	[edX-5-learnerTrajectoryNet.R](https://github.com/mginda/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/blob/master/edX-5-learnerTrajectoryNet.R) script uses the logs processed edx-4-eventLogFormatter.R, and the course structure data set generated by edX-1-courseStructureMeta.R script. The script creates a learner trajectory network for each student in the course based on the individual’s processed event logs, by first creating an edge list to document transitions between modules in a course, and then creating a node list, which calculates interaction statistics for each low level module in the course. The nodes and edge lists data sets are combined into a JSON formatted learner trajectory network.
 
## A Note on Using the Learner Trajectory Network Pipeline
The processing scripts are provided under Apache License 2.0. Contributors provide permission for commercial use, modification, distribution, patent use, and private use.  Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code. The script is provided with a limited liability and warranty, use these data processing scripts with your own discretion, and make preservation copies of any source data prior to use.
Additional modifications are likely needed to make use of this pipeline when processing other course data sets that using the edX Data Package format specification. Organizational implementation of the edX learning management systems may use customized event log tracking systems, and courses may use different types of edX block modules, and logs may include types of events that were not encountered for this project (e.g. error events, or edX discussion forums). An exploratory analysis of the course structure and event logs is advisable at the outset of a project.
